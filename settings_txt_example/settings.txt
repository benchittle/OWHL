// settings.txt file for OWHL
// Install this file in the root directory of your 
// microSD card if you want to change the sampling time
// and duration, or change the mission info. 
// All lines that start with a / are ignored
// The file should have only one uncommented line, and it
// should consist of three entries separated by commas:
// startMinute, dataDuration, missionInfo
// startMinute is a value 0 to 59, setting what minute
// of every hour the OWHL should start logging data. 
// dataDuration is a value 1 to 60 that sets how many
// minutes of each hour to sample
// missionInfo is a text/numeric entry of up to 50 
// characters that will be inserted into the header
// of every output file. Do not use commas in the 
// missionInfo entry. 
// An example entry: 0,60,JFK pier sensor 1
// This example will start sampling at minute 0 of
// every hour and continue for 60 minutes (continuous
// sampling). Each output file will contain the text
// "JFK pier sensor 1" in the first row.
