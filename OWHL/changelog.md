Changelog

----------

Early changelog from "Sleeptests.ino" sketches
```
v27 Changing some pin assignments to suit the new OWHL PCB discs.
        
	v26 Putting code back in to allow different sampling rates besides 4Hz. 
	Change the value of SAMPLES_PER_SECOND in the preamble to 4, 2 or 1 as
	desired. 
	
	v25 Adds code to convert the pressure and temperature floating point values 
	into truncated character strings before writing to the SD card, in part to 
	try speeding up write times, but also because the extra digits of precision 
	currently being transmitted are bogus anyways. 
 
	v24 Trying to make periodic sampling regime functional. This version will
	only generate 1 file per day, and simply append new samples to the end of
	the daily file during each sampling interval (usually 30 minute periods). 
	Change the values of STARTMINUTE and DATADURATION below to change the start
	time and length of data taking period. STARTMINUTE can be set from 0 to 59
	and DATADURATION can be from 1 to 60.
	This version is set to use the DS3231 Chronodot's 32.768kHz output to run
	TIMER2. During lowPowerSleep (when not taking data), this version will 
	briefly flash the LED on D9 to indicate when it has awakened and returned
	to sleep.
 
 * v23 Trying to implement a periodic sampling regime that starts at a 
 * user-designated time and continues for some number of minutes, then goes 
 * into a deep watchdog-timed sleep for the remainder of the hour. But for some
 * reason the sketch isn't properly waking from the 8s sleep when it finishes
 * the data-taking cycle. It does sleep 8s cycles fine BEFORE the data taking
 * but not after. Very strange. 
 * 
  v22 Added code to update the file creation date and modify date so that
  it makes some sense. Writing 1 second's worth of data to the SD card
  takes about 120ms based on timing this sketch, in large part because 
  there are a lot of values being streamed to the card. 

  v21 Changed the end of the setup loop slightly so that TIMER2 doesn't
  start running until the real time clock has started a new second.
  With the f_wdt flag set to 1 initially, the main loop should immediately
  take a data reading (as if it is at the 0 ms mark).
  This is an attempt to better sync the 32.768 watch crystal with the timing
  of the real time clock. v20 was dropping 1 second of data every once in
  a while, probably because the two clocks were out of sync.

  v20 Change from built-in SD library to the SdFat library.
  https://code.google.com/p/sdfatlib/downloads/list <-- sdfatlib20131225.zip
  Fixing the write-to-SD interval at 1 second (4 samples) since the write
  time scales linearly with the buffer size, so there is no gain from increasing
  the time between SD writes.
  Moved all filename initialization code to the function initFileName so that
  it can be called from anywhere in the program to generate a new filename
  based on the current date.
  Added code to keep track of day (oldday) and generate a new filename when
  the new date is different from the day stored in oldday. This should start
  a new output file every night at midnight.

  v19 Implement a file naming scheme based on date + time from Chronodot
  DS3231 real time clock. Filenames will follow the pattern YYMMDDXX.CSV
  where the XX is a counter (0 - 99) for files generated on the same day.
  It also adds a 2nd indicator LED to Arduino
  pin D8 (PINB0, physical pin 14) to indicate when the card initialization
  fails.

  v18 Switched to new MS5803_05/14 style library for pressure sensor. These
  new libraries correctly carry out the pressure calculations without
  variable overflows.

  v17 This sketch implements a button on pin 2 (interrupt 0) to stop the
  data logging process (see the function endRun). Once stopped, the
  watchdog timer is set to 8 second timeouts, and the LED is flashed
  briefly to indicate that data logging has stopped and the processor
  is sleeping. This version also implements a set of data storage
  arrays so that writes to the SD card only happen once per second.
